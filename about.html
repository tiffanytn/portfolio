                <h1>What is my design story?</h1>
                <br>
                <p>As you can tell by this point of the website, my name is Tiffany and I am currently a senior at 
                    the University of California, Irvine studying Informatics and Human-Computer Interaction.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Initially, design was understood as strictly aesthetics and visuals and so, my 
                    beginnings in design reflected that (meaning, I did a lot of graphic design). 
                    I later stumbled into the world of human-centered design and user-experience and 
                    have been tinkering and growing as a designer in this corner of technology since. 

                </p>

                <p>I seek to understand and work within the intersection between design, technology, 
                    and psychology to ultimately craft meaningful and evidence-driven experiences and 
                    solutions that meet user and business needs. I have grown an interest in product 
                    design and consider myself a generalist; I like getting into a bit of everything: 
                    user research, ux design, and visual design as it allows me to carry and take into 
                    consideration my understanding of the problem and user’s need from beginning to end. 
                </p>

                <p>Whe I am not designing, you will most likely find me trying my hand at film photography, 
                    cooking (this is a new one), and curating playlists on Spotify. I have also had the 
                    fortune of revamping and directing a design-oriented, student organization at UC Irvine 
                    called Design at UCI! So if you are a designer and looking to give back and share your 
                    wisdom to some aspiring designers, that’s a great place to start!
                </p>

                <p>If I have sparked your curiousity enough for you to consider chatting with me on anything, 
                    I would say (in the words of a close friend) don’t be a stranger!  
                </p>
