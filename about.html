                        <h1>What is my design story?</h1>
                        <br>
                        <p>As you can tell by this point of the website, my name is Tiffany and I am full-spectrum designer
                             (or product designer) based in Southern California. Currently, I am a senior at the University 
                             of California, Irvine studying <a href="https://www.informatics.uci.edu/">Informatics and Human-Computer Interaction</a>.
                        <p>
                            Initially, design was understood as strictly aesthetics and visuals and so, my 
                            beginnings in design reflected that (meaning, I did a lot of graphic design). 
                            I later stumbled into the world of human-centered design and user-experience and 
                            have been tinkering and and learning how to use design to translate problems and needs 
                            into opportunities since. 
        
                        </p>
        
                        <p>I seek to understand and work within the intersection between design, technology, 
                            and psychology to ultimately craft meaningful and evidence-driven experiences and 
                            solutions that meet user and business needs. I have grown an interest in product 
                            design and consider myself a generalist; I like getting into a bit of everything: 
                            user research, ux design, and visual design as it allows me to carry and take into 
                            consideration my understanding of the problem and user’s need from beginning to end. 
                        </p>
        
                        <p>Whe I am not designing, you will most likely find me trying my hand at film photography, 
                            cooking (this is a new one), and curating playlists on Spotify. I have also had the 
                            fortune of revamping and directing a design-oriented, student organization at UC Irvine 
                            called <a href="designatuci.com">Design at UCI</a>! So if you are a designer and looking to give back and share your 
                            wisdom to some aspiring designers, that’s a great place to start!
                        </p>
        
                        <p>If I have sparked your curiousity enough for you to consider chatutting with me on anything, 
                            I would say (in the words of a close friend) don’t be a stranger!  
                        </p>
