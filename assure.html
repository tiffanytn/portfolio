                    <p>If you’ve ever felt wary walking out at night by yourself, unsure of how to protect 
                        yourself from a harasser, or want a space to communicate with others who’ve gone through 
                        similar situations, Assure aims to provide solutions to address these very problems. 
                        Currently, there is a lack of resources as well as support available for individuals 
                        who may be at risk or who have experienced some form of sexual harassment. </p>

                    <p>After extensive user research, ideation, usability testing, and iterations, we refined our 
                        solution in the form of 4 features (interactive map, live tracking/check-ins, reporting,
                         and community forum). These features were designed to address different problems and
                          user needs at different points in a <a class="link" href="#journey">user’s journey</a>. Read more about how we arrived at 
                          these 4 features by jumping past this section.</p>

                            <p>As a team, we collected 126 survey responses and conducted 6 semi-structured user 
                                interviews. Of those 6 interviews, I facilitated two interviews.

                            <p>To our surprise, people’s preferred choice of protection revolved more around preventative 
                                measures and efforts that provided them a sense of security rather than relying on actual 
                                protective weapons. Some protective measures are efforts that attempt to dissuade 
                                aggressors from making advances or put them out of harms way  (for example, pretending 
                                to call someone or avoiding certain areas). 
                            </p>

                            <p>While some individuals, particularly in our user interviews, noted that they did carry protective weapons 
                                like pepper spray, they brought up that they seldom use it and feel like they wouldn’t react fast enough or feel like they 
                                could adequately use it when a situation was to arise.</p>

                            <p>While going through our research data/insights, we noticed that the problems and struggles individuals 
                                faced covered what we identified as 3 main phases: before the (or a potential) sexual 
                                harassment encounter, during the encounter, and after the encounter. 
                            </p>
                            <p>From our user research, we had learned that prior to a trip, users do some decision-making
                                 (for example, on where they are heading, who they are going with, what path they take) 
                                 and some of that decision-making involves consideration of their safety. In this case, 
                                 they would consider things, often preventative measures, such as areas and times they 
                                 want to avoid. During a trip, they would want to feel a greater sense of security, find 
                                 ways to thwart potential encounters, and overall react quickly enough or remove themselves
                                  from a dangerous situation. After an encounter, they would likely want to confide in 
                                  someone and/or find support, figure out next steps and whether they should take action. 
                                  With all this information in mind and visualized on our journey map, we  brainstormed 
                                  different design solutions that could address the user’s needs within those stages.

                            <p>To test the usability of our designs, as well as validate our product concept and features, I assisted in 
                                facilitating 3 of the 6 moderated usability tests and writing the script for said test. The test script was 
                                written to cover different use cases that touched upon our main features and were written as scenarios to 
                                help test participants use our clickable Figma prototype in the context of the scenario. We employed a 
                                think-aloud protocol and conducted our first round of testing via the Figma Mirror application for the 
                                mobile design and a paper prototype for the IoT wearable device.

                            <p>Over half of our test participants in the first round found icons, such as those on the navigation bar 
                                and on the interactive map, confusing and spent considerable time incorrectly clicking around the 
                                interface before navigating to the correct destination. We decided to test out the icons on the navigation bar 
                                through first-click testing on usabilityhub.com using 3 variations we designed for a single icon. Below, 
                                we have the live-tracking feature which we tested for accuracy and click time.

                                        The issue of sexual harassment is no easy problem to tackle, but it is an issue that resonated with most of 
                                        my teammates and me. In one of our user interviews, when asked what they believe is are some causes or 
                                        big issues surrounding the topic of sexual harassment, they simply answered “I think men are just the 
                                        problem.” Of course, this is a generalization (and males are not the only gender to be aggressors in sexual 
                                        harassment cases), but this statement underscores that there are some underlying problems (whether that be 
                                        misogyny, stigma, etc.) that lead to sexual harassment that are not easily solved through 
                                        just applications. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        While acknowleding that limitation, we instead wanted to focus on opportunities and ways 
                                        to alleviate and aid our target users. A good portion of individuals mentioned how they 
                                        wanted to handle their situations on their own and not involve so many people and so,
                                         we set out to empower individuals to find ways to inform themselves and potentially 
                                         prevent such incidents from happening and protect themself—if necessary.  What we aimed 
                                         to do, with our scope in mind, was to refocus on the user and image ways they can take 
                                         control of the situation.

                        <p>
                            One of the biggest questions and considerations that we had to keep in mind throughout this project was the 
                            context in which our product is used by potential users. Given that our device may be used in high-risk 
                            scenarios, it was important to consider the context in which they could be used.We discovered that many 
                            individuals admit to not using existing protective weapons or devices, like pepper spray, because they were 
                            not in reach or they themselves were unable to react quickly enough to use them. Other considerations included 
                            affordances for the panic button on both mobile devices and our IoT device. A simple press for panic button on 
                            either would not be ideal for accidental presses, so we had to consider other affordances such as long presses. 
                            One aspect that I would have changed, specifically within the visual design, would have been to implement a 
                            “dark-mode” or darker color palette. Our user research have highlighted that a lot of people feel most 
                            uncomfortable and worried walking at night; a darker interface may be more suitable for night trips so as not 
                            to attract attention. Of course, a dark-mode interface can still be implemented
